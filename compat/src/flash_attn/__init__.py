"""Drop-in `import flash_attn` shim for `flash-attn-mojo`.

This package exists only to make `flash_attn_mojo` callable as
`flash_attn` for code originally written against the upstream Tri Dao
`flash-attn` library. The whole implementation lives in the
`flash_attn_mojo` package; this file just re-exports the public API
and refuses to load if upstream is also installed.

# package's submodules are left behind, producing a Frankenstein
# namespace. If our `__init__.py` is the one Python loaded but
# upstream's `flash_attn_interface.py` is sitting next to it, fail
# loudly instead of silently picking a half-installed winner.
